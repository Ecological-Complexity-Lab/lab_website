    A distinguished guest arrived in the middle of June. Prof. Diego Vazquez came all the way from Argentina to visit our Department of Life Science.
Diego delivered an exceptional seminar, enriching our academic community. It was also a great opportunity for Shai’s students to engage with Diego, sharing their research and benefiting from his expertise. The visit was also marked with hanging out at Shai’s place with his family, eating home made falafel and hiking in the desert.

Later that night, went to a lovely Thai restaurant then stayed at an apatment in Haifa, and enjoying a fun-filled social evening. The next day, we went for a tour in the Bahai gardens, then went on a scenic hike in “Little Switzerland” right on Mt. Carmel, which offered breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. We finished up with a refreshing ice cream. For a small glimpse into the trip, have a look at the pictures below.

    Dr. Shai and Ying-Jie Wang visited the University of Liverpool last week.
They spent time in Dr. James Hall’s lab. Their time was marked by fruitful discussions, sharing of project outcomes, and strategic planning. 
Additionally, Dr. Shai took the stage to present a seminar, ‘A Complex Systems View on Microbial Communities,’ at the Department of Evolution, Ecology, and Behaviour in the Institute of Infection, Veterinary, and Ecological Sciences.
The trip provided a valuable opportunity for both teams to synchronize efforts and enhance our collaborative project.
