    On June 25, 2024, Dr. Ying-Jie Wang, a postdoc student in our lab, presented her previous research at the Mitrani Seminar, Sde Boker campus of BGU. Her talk, “Thermal Evolution Shapes the Thermal Effects on Predator-Prey Interaction,” provided valuable insights into how temperature changes influence ecological interactions and stability. The seminar highlighted key findings on the interaction between freshwater predators (damselfly larvae) and their prey (water fleas) under varying temperature conditions. It was a great talk.

    Following EcoNet2023, Johannes Nauta (postdoctoral researcher, Dept. of Physics, University of Padua, Italy) extended his stay in our lab for an extra week as part of our HFSP-funded collaboration project. Ying Jie and Johannes led intensive discussions and worked hard to model microbiome population dynamics under perturbations using different approaches. Johannes employed ODE systems in his modeling approach, while Ying Jie explored the domain of agent-based modeling. It was a productive week and we are looking forward to the results.
