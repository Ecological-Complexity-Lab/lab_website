<p>By bringing concepts from ecological networks and applying them to molecular biology, we found a non-random, hierarchical pattern within the chaperone-client interaction networks operating in different cancer tissues. These findings could inform the development of cancer-specific drug therapies targeting these key chaperone-client interaction network components.</p>
