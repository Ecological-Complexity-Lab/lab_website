<p>In this study, we applied a network-based approach to investigate the assembly processes shaping host-microbe interactions in wild black rats (Rattus rattus) across a land-use gradient in Madagascar. By using a moving prevalence threshold, we separated core and non-core microbes and compared the ecological drivers influencing their network structures. Our findings reveal that core and non-core microbial communities are shaped by distinct processes: non-core microbes were primarily governed by deterministic forces, linked to environmental variation across the gradient, while core microbes were structured mainly by stochastic processes. This approach offers a powerful framework for disentangling the complex interactions between hosts, microbes, and their environment.</p>

<p>The study introduces an inductive link-prediction framework trained on hundreds of ecological networks to infer missing species interactions in poorly sampled systems. By pooling data across plant–pollinator, host–parasite, plant–herbivore, and plant–seed-disperser communities, the model outperforms traditional approaches. We also provide a pre-trained online tool and Python package, enabling rapid predictions to guide ecological research and field validation.</p>
