<p>In this study, we evaluate how local knowledge contributes to effective fisheries co-management in a spatially connected river system. Using a process-based metapopulation model informed by empirical data, we assess alternative management strategies for pirarucu fisheries across protected and unprotected lakes in the Brazilian Amazon. We find that protected lakes play a critical role in sustaining populations and buffering fishing pressure, and that the current local-knowledge–based strategy performs nearly as well as the optimal, model-derived approach. Our results demonstrate the value of integrating local knowledge, ecology, and network theory to guide sustainable resource management across complex socio-ecological systems.</p>

<p>In this study, we introduce a spatially explicit network-based framework to predict missing species interactions while explicitly accounting for spatial variability in ecological communities. Applying the method to plant–pollinator networks across the Canary Islands, we show that latent network structure alone contains strong predictive power for identifying unobserved links. Predictive accuracy depended critically on spatial context, with performance highest when information was drawn from nearby, ecologically similar sites and declining with geographic and ecological distance. Our results highlight that incorporating spatial structure is essential for reliable link prediction and for uncovering the ecological processes shaping complex interaction networks.</p>

<p>The study, previously available as a preprint, is now published following peer-review in Ecology Letters!</p>

<p>In this study, we applied a network-based approach to investigate the assembly processes shaping host-microbe interactions in wild black rats (Rattus rattus) across a land-use gradient in Madagascar. By using a moving prevalence threshold, we separated core and non-core microbes and compared the ecological drivers influencing their network structures. Our findings reveal that core and non-core microbial communities are shaped by distinct processes: non-core microbes were primarily governed by deterministic forces, linked to environmental variation across the gradient, while core microbes were structured mainly by stochastic processes. This approach offers a powerful framework for disentangling the complex interactions between hosts, microbes, and their environment.</p>

<p>In this study, we develop a theoretical microbe-plasmid model to investigate when plasmid-carrying bacteria can invade or be eliminated from microbial populations. We show that heterogeneity in competition between plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free strains can generate bistability, allowing multiple stable outcomes under the same conditions. This structure creates the potential for abrupt regime shifts and hysteresis in plasmid dynamics. Our results provide new insights into how plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance might be controlled or eradicated through targeted interventions.</p>

<p>In this study, we show that individual hosts differ in consistent and predictable ways in their parasite infection profiles, with important consequences for transmission dynamics and spillover risk. Using network modeling and machine learning on black rats sampled across Madagascar, our students identify three distinct infection profiles that reflect different roles in parasite transmission. Host traits such as body mass and microbiome composition were substantially more informative than environmental factors in predicting these profiles. Our results highlight infection profiles as a powerful lens for understanding host-parasite dynamics and improving risk prediction at human–animal interfaces.</p>
