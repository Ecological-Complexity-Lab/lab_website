In this study, we evaluate how local knowledge contributes to effective fisheries co-management in a spatially connected river system. Using a process-based metapopulation model informed by empirical data, we assess alternative management strategies for pirarucu fisheries across protected and unprotected lakes in the Brazilian Amazon. We find that protected lakes play a critical role in sustaining populations and buffering fishing pressure, and that the current local-knowledge–based strategy performs nearly as well as the optimal, model-derived approach. Our results demonstrate the value of integrating local knowledge, ecology, and network theory to guide sustainable resource management across complex socio-ecological systems.
