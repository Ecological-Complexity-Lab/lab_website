In this study, we show that adaptive evolution can reshape the structure of metabolic networks, creating complex phenotypes that link mutations to fitness. As part of a collaboration with [Shimon Bershtein's lab](https://lifewp.bgu.ac.il/wp/shimonb/), our student evolved a metabolically impaired E. coli strain, and demonstrated that fitness gains arise from large-scale rewiring of metabolite correlation networks, producing smaller, more cohesive, and better-connected clusters. These results highlight metabolite correlation networks as a powerful framework for uncovering emergent phenotypes that drive metabolic adaptation.
