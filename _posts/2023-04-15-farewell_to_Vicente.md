Time flies! A year has passed, and itâ€™s time to say goodbye to Vicente, who has completed his internship in our lab. We hope his time in Israel was fulfilling both personally and professionally. We do not doubt that Vicente will continue to make meaningful contributions to the field. Take care, Vicente, and all the best!
