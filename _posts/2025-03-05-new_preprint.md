In this study, we show that agricultural intensification increases crop yields but severely undermines the ecosystem services that support sustainable farming. Using an ecological network from an organic farm, our students reveal that losses of indirect interactions, not just species, drive major declines in ecosystem service. While crop production nearly doubled, indirect ecological links collapsed, destabilizing the system as a whole. These results highlight that protecting species interactions is essential for maintaining resilient agroecosystems.
