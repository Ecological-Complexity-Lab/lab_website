The study uses the rumen microbiome of 1,012 cows in seven European farms as a case study to explore the complex interactions between microbes in highly diverse environments. Through multilayer network analysis, we unveil scale-dependent signatures of microbial co-occurrence, shedding light on the underlying processes that structure these networks. The multilayer network analysis approach used in this study could be applied to other contexts to study microbial communities and their functions.
