A distinguished guest arrived in the middle of June. [Prof. Diego Vazquez](https://interactio.org/group/dvazquez/) came all the way from Argentina to visit our Department of Life Science.
Diego delivered an exceptional seminar, enriching our academic community. It was also a great opportunity for Shaiâ€™s students to engage with Diego, sharing their research and benefiting from his expertise. The visit was also marked with hanging out at Shai's place with his family, eating home made falafel and hiking in the desert. 
We hope Diego enjoyed his time in Israel, and hope we get to see him again!
