This year, Shai hosted the EcoNet2023 workshop (Ecological networks from theory to application) at Ben Gurion University, Israel.

Seeing everything come together after all the planning and hard work was exciting. Shai’s hard work and dedication made this workshop a reality.

Four days are full of multiple kinds of activities from keynote talks to invited talks, posters, working groups, deep-dives, dinner, and a hike.

This mix of activities was designed to engage participants in discussions, develop new ideas, make valuable connections to form collaborations in the future, and learn new methods.
Hope that all participants took full advantage of this enriching opportunity.

Don’t forget to mark your calendars – EcoNet2025 will take place in Newcastle!
