Our paper titled “Multilayer networks of plasmid genetic similarity reveal potential pathways of gene transmission” was published on February 9th, 2023, in “The ISME Journall” under the DOI [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-023-01373-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-023-01373-5). The study utilized multilayer networks to analyze the genetic similarity between plasmids in a population of dairy cows and sheds light on the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across animal hosts.
