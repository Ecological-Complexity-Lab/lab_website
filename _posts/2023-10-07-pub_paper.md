Our paper, “Ecological network analysis reveals cancer-dependent chaperone-client interaction structure and robustness, ” was officially published in “Nature Communications” on October 7th, 2023. 

By bringing concepts from ecological networks and applying them to molecular biology, we found a non-random, hierarchical pattern within the chaperone-client interaction networks operating in different cancer tissues. These findings could inform the development of cancer-specific drug therapies targeting these key chaperone-client interaction network components.
