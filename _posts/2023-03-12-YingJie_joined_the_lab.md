Ying Jie Wang, a postdoctoral researcher, has recently joined our lab in March. Originally from Taiwan, she brings a wealth of knowledge in stress ecology, community ecology, and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Despite being with us for just a month, she has already become a key player in our international collaborative project on agent-based modeling of highly-diverse microbial communities. This project brings together ecology and evolution, microbiology, and statistical physics. We are excited to have Ying Jie with us and wish her the best of luck in her research. Welcome to the Lab, Ying Jie!
