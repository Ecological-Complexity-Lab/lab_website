Itamar recently visited Prof. Peter J. Mucha at the Department of Mathematics at Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH) to discuss a new collaboration on antimicrobial resistance prediction. The visit sparked productive conversations and fresh ideas for moving the project forward.

Following that, Itamar and Shai, traveled to Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) to participate in a workshop organized by the Land-use and disease in Madagascar collaboration. They presented recent findings, connected with researchers working on related projects, and contributed to planning the next phases of the collaboration. Both visits were highly rewarding, strengthening key partnerships and opening up exciting new directions for future research.
