Our paper titled “Invasive species modulate the structure and stability of a multilayer mutualistic network” published on June 28th, 2023, in “THE ROYAL SOCIETY” under the DOI [https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2023.0132](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0132)
Our model system and multilayer network analysis allow us to examine the broader consequences of disturbances, such as invasive species, on the structure and stability of multitrophic networks.
