Our article “Practical guidelines and the EMLN R package for handling ecological multilayer networks” was published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution on October 18, 2023. We’ve developed the EMLN R package, which simplifies working with ecological multilayer networks. It helps organize your multilayer network to use it with other popular tools. Plus, we’ve included practice data sets and step-by-step examples to help you get started.

Give the EMLN R package a try for your multilayer network.
