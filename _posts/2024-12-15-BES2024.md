In December 2024, our lab had the excellent opportunity to participate in the [BES 2024](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/content/bes-annual-meeting-2024/) conference, organized by the British Ecological Society, in the city of Liverpool, UK. Our lab made its mark with the excellent talks delivered by Shai and Tino, and posters presented by Ying-Jie, Matan and Itamar. \
While travling to liverpool the meet took the oppotrtunity to also visit [Jamie Hall](https://ecomplab.com/members/james_hall.html) and perticipate in a joint meeting of his group and the groups of Andy Fenton and Venera Tyukmaeva. \
This trip was the perfect opportunity for enhancing existing collaborations, initiating new partnerships and reconnecting with friends from other labs, while having fun doing it. Take a longer look at their experience in the [gallary](https://ecomplab.com/gallery/)!
