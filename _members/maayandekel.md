I am a lab manager at BGU. I also completed my undergraduate research project in this lab, on the genetic mechanisms underlying the structure of host-virus networks. I am still discovering various interests in biology, and am particularly interested in ecological networks. In my free time I enjoy competing in debate and crocheting.
