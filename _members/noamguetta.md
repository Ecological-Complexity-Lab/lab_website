I'm a Bsc student in the life sciences department. In my research, I use computational and bioinformatical methods to find the ultimate and proximate explanations for the evolution of the ESCRT machinery - which is a membrane remodeling system, in Asgard Archaea, which is considered today as the sister group of eukaryotes. In my free time, I like being in the Israel biology team, reading and learning about all kinds of biology, and playing D&D with my friends.
