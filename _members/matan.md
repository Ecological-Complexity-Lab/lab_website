I am a PhD student at BGU. My research focuses on the effects of environmental gradients and land-use changes on the structure of ecological networks, from the microbiome to host-parasite interactions and disease transmission. In my free time I enjoy reading, climbing, traveling, and tracking.

### A little about my research:
Human-driven land use changes disrupt ecosystems and can alter the spread of infectious diseases. My research examines how habitat degradation influences interactions between small mammal hosts, their microbiomes, and pathogens. Using network analysis and modeling, I investigate how microbiome and pathogen composition vary across different land use types and how microbiome-pathogen interactions shape infection patterns. Understanding these complex relationships is crucial for predicting disease risks, including potential spillover to humans. By highlighting the interconnected roles of hosts, microbes, pathogens, and the environment, my work provides insights to help mitigate the impact of land use change on disease transmission.
