<!-- I am a post-doctoral researcher at BGU from Argentina. I am interested in understanding the complex interaction between humans and nature. In particular, my research focuses on invasive species, ecosystem services, and community ecology. In my free time, I enjoy doing outdoor activities, such as hiking and climbing. -->

I am a post-doctoral researcher at BGU. I am an ecologist broadly interested in community ecology, ecosystem services and global change. My research focuses on understanding how ecological interactions respond to different drives of global change (e.g. land use change and invasive species) and its consequent impacts on the provision of ecosystem services. In my research, I employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating field observations with state-of-the-art methods and theory from network science and ecology.

## A little about my research:
Balancing the need to feed a growing human population while preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services is a major global challenge. However, the impacts of land conversion on multiple ecosystem services remain poorly understood. My research combines empirical data with ecological network approach, simulations, and models to explore the effects of land conversion from extensive organic to intensive non-organic management on crop production and numerous ecosystem services. By revealing how land use change shapes the interplay among multiple ecosystem services, my work provides critical insights to inform policies and land management strategies for sustainable agroecosystems.
