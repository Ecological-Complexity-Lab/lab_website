I am a PhD student at BGU.  My research focuses on spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological communities. I enjoy nature, being with my family and doing geeky stuff.

### A little about my research:
Ecological communities are dynamic and ever-changing, making it difficult to fully understand how species interact. One major challenge is the presence of ‘missing links’—interactions that go unobserved but are crucial to grasping the bigger picture. Predicting these hidden connections could revolutionize how we study ecosystems, helping us anticipate the effects of climate change, invasive species, extinctions, and other disruptions. While recent advances in ecological modeling have improved link prediction, many approaches fail to account for the natural variability of ecosystems over time and space. My research addresses this gap by developing advanced models that leverage diverse data from various locations and time points to predict interactions in other locations and in future time points. By uncovering patterns in how species interact, this work will contribute both to ecological theory and to practical conservation efforts.
