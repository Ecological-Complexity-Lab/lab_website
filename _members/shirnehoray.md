I'm a Master’s student in Life Sciences at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Since the third year of my bachelor’s degree, I have been a member of the Ecological Complexity Lab. My current research focuses on predicting interactions across different plant-pollinator networks. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places with my dog.

Research:

My research investigates how well cross-network validation can be used to evaluate and compare the accuracy of interaction prediction models across different spatial plant-pollinator studies in Europe. 

Experience:

2022–2025 – B.Sc. in Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev

2025–Present – M.Sc. student in Life Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev

2024–Present – Teaching Assistant, Jusidman Science Center for Youth, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev
