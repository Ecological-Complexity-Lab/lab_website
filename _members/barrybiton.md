I am a masterâ€™s student of biology at Ben-Gurion University. I am mainly curious about exploring and gaining insights from biological data. My research concerns prediction of ecological interactions in multilayer networks. Besides research, I enjoy casual gaming, 3D printing, and spending time with my (crazy) dog.
