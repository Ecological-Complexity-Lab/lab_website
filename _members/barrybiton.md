I am a PhD student of biology at Ben-Gurion University. I am mainly curious about exploring and gaining insights from biological data. My research concerns prediction of ecological interactions in multilayer networks. Besides research, I enjoy casual gaming, 3D printing, and spending time with my (crazy) dog.

## A little about my research:
The vast complexity of ecological communities presents a significant challenge in understanding and predicting species interactions. My research advances ecological network science by developing innovative machine learning approaches to predict missing interactions in ecological networks. I leverage inductive link prediction (ILP) and transfer learning to overcome the limitations of sparse and incomplete ecological data. By pooling information across different types of ecological communitiesâ€”my work enables more accurate predictions of species interactions than traditional methods. Beyond the methodological advancement, my research provides a practical tool for ecologists through a pre-trained model that can make instant predictions for new networks.
