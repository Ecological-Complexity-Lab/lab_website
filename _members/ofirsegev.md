I am a 3rd-year computational biology student at BGU. My main interests are ecology, evolution, and genetics. In my project I study the network structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics between viruses and hosts in CRISPR-induced immune diversification. My hobbies are cooking, playing the ukulele, and traveling.
