I am a 3rd-year student of computer science, in the bioinformatics track, at BGU. I am excited about biology, astronomy, and probability. In my project, I am exploring the robustness in consumption-production networks of bacteria and metabolites. My downtime includes watching Netflix and eating ice-cream, and I also love to travel.
