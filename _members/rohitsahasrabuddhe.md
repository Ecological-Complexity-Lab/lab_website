I am a masterâ€™s student from India doing my research project at BGU. At work, I use network science to model complex systems with the goal of creating some insights into them. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling to new places and meeting new people. When indoors, I can usually be found over-analysing music, lost in a sci-fi book, or wishing to be outdoors.

Rohit later got accepted as a PhD student at Oxford university.
