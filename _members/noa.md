I am a masterâ€™s student of biology at BGU. My research interests revolve around stress ecology, while focusing on the response of bacterial communities to environmental changes. I enjoy traveling, cooking and spending time with my friends.

### A little about my research:
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) enables microbes to exchange genetic material, with plasmids serving as key carriers of traits like antibiotic resistance. My research explores HGT dynamics in microbial communities, focusing on how different network structures influence plasmid persistence and microbial evolution. By integrating network theory, ecological principles, and computational modeling, I use an agent-based model (ABM) and stochastic simulations to investigate factors like super-spreading and modularity in HGT networks. I aim to predict plasmid behavior under antibiotic perturbations, providing new insights into antibiotic resistance, microbial ecology, and evolutionary biology.
