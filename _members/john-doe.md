I am a post-doctoral researcher at BGU from Argentina. I am interested in understanding the complex interaction between humans and nature. In particular, my research focuses on invasive species, ecosystem services, and community ecology. In my free time, I enjoy doing outdoor activities, such as hiking and climbing.
