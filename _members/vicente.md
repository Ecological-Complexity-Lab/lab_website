I am a Margarita Salas post-doctoral researcher at the University of Girona (Spain), visiting BGU for a year. I am interested in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecological communities, using models to gain knowledge across multiple scales. In my free time, I like running, birdwatching, and to discover new stories, whether itâ€™s with a book, a podcast, or a movie.
