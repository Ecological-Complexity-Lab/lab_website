First Year direct PhD student of Life Sciences at Ben-Gurion University. As undergraduate student at BGU, I participated in "Dkalim" excellence program, which accelerates my journey towards advanced degree. Since my second year, I'm a member of the "Ecological Complexity Lab". My current work centers around investigating host-pathogen interactions of small mammals in Madagascar across a human land-use gradient. My academic interests encompass ecology, microbiology, network science, and evolution. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, climbing, playing the piano and watching good movies.
