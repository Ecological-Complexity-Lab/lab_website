Direct PhD student of Life Sciences at Ben-Gurion University. As undergraduate student at BGU, I participated in "Dkalim" excellence program, which accelerates my journey towards advanced degree. Since my second year, I'm a member of the "Ecological Complexity Lab". My current work centers around investigating host-pathogen interactions of small mammals in Madagascar across a human land-use gradient. My academic interests encompass ecology, microbiology, network science, and evolution. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, climbing, playing the piano and watching good movies.

### A little about my research:
Infectious diseases pose a major threat to human health, wildlife, and ecosystems, making it crucial to understand how and why infections occur. My research in disease ecology leverages advanced computational methods, including network analysis and machine learning, to investigate the factors that predict infection risk. I study the complex interactions between hosts and their pathogens—whether parasites, microbes, or viruses—to uncover patterns that drive disease transmission. By identifying key predictors of infection, my work provides valuable insights that can inform disease prevention, wildlife conservation, and public health strategies.
