After earning my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Open University, I became captivated by the elegance of complex systems theory and the non-linear modeling of life. This fascination inspired me to pursue an M.Sc. in the Department of Life Sciences, where I joined the EcoComplexity Lab. The search for harmony between order and chaos—a theme central to these theories—has since shaped not only my academic and professional path but also my artistic interest in my free time.

## Research

Rapid land-use change presents a growing set of risks, particularly as it expands the interface between human and natural environments. One critical consequence is the rising incidence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases. Yet, much of the existing research on these dynamics centers on developed regions, leaving the complex and distinct land-use patterns of underdeveloped areas largely unexplored.

In many such regions, land use is shaped by highly dynamic practices, such as shifting cultivation and agroforestry. My research addresses this gap by focusing on tick-borne diseases in Madagascar’s Sava region. Drawing on empirical data, I develop models that simulate both tick population dynamics and their interactions with evolving land-use configurations. Additionally, I project future land-use scenarios under different economic trajectories, allowing for a deeper understanding of how global forces—such as fluctuations in vanilla prices—can influence local disease dynamics.
