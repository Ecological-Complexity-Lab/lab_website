I am a 3rd-year biology student at BGU and working in the lab as a data analyst. My main interests are genetics, ecology and microbiology. Currently I am working on data collection to develop an ecological network database for the lab. My hobbies include traveling, hiking and growing plants.

Noa later got accepted as a Masterâ€™s student at Weizmann Institute of Science.
