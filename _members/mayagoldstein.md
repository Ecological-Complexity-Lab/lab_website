I am a 3rd year undergrad student at BGU. My main interests are ecology and genetics. In my current project I study the modular multilayer structure of plant-pollinator networks. I love baking, reading and watching fantasy and sci fi movies.

Maya later got accepted as a DVM student at Hebrew University.
