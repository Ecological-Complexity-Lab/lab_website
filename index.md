# Ecology, Network Science & Data science

All ecological systems are complex. How are they structured? How do they evolve? How does complexity affect ecosystem function? Our lab is a hub for studying the complexity underlying ecological systems. Our research combines modeling, simulations, data analysis and ecological theory in a variety of ecosystems. **Our multidisciplinary work lies on the interface between biology and network science, providing excellent opportunities for students to work on interesting and challenging topics while gaining a broad set of skills to conduct research both in academia and outside.** 

**We believe in making honest, open science in a way that is engaging, collaborative and emphasizes good working-relations.**

We characterize the complexity of ecological systems to understand its nature and consequences. We combine modeling, simulations, data analysis and ecological/evolutionary theory.
