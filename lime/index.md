title: "Link prediction in ecological networks"

The LIME (Large Interaction Model in Ecology) model leverages inductive learning, pooling data from multiple networks and incorporating structural similarities across diverse ecological communities. This allows it to generalize predictions across networks, even those that do not share species or direct interactions with the training set.
