<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Course description**</span> 

Biological systems, and specifically ecological systems, contain multiple entities that interconnect to form networks. These include gene interaction networks, food webs, plant-pollinator networks, metapopulations and networks of disease transmission. How these networks are structured is crucial for the dynamics and functioning of biological systems. This course will introduce the theory and methods for working with biological networks. Though primarily motivated by ecology, the theory and methodology we will cover is also relevant for other fields in biology, such as neuroscience, systems biology and epidemiology. Students will be actively involved in classes via paper discussions. Therefore, there is a limit of 12 students. The course, class discussions and presentations will be given in English. For the final project, students are encouraged to use their own research data. **Course material and weekly meeting topics may vary from what is currently written in the syllabus at the instructor's discretion during the semester.**
  
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**The course goals are to provide students with:**</span> 
1. An understanding of the (ecological) theory underlying the structure and dynamics of complex systems.
2. Tools to perform network analysis on a variety of network types.
3. Skills: programming and analysis of network data, advanced paper reading, presenting research, scientific writing.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Course requirements and grading:**</span> 
* Compulsory attendance to lectures
* Compulsory attendance to exercises
* Grade components: Project description (5%), final report (in English) 45%, presentation of project 20%, paper discussion 20%, active participation 10%.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Academic and general requirements:**</span> 
1. The exercises are computational and students are required to bring a laptop
2. Exercises are **not for submission** but are recommended for hands-on experience. Exercises are written in R. Students who would like to program in another language are welcomed to do so **independently**.
3. Recommended (not necessary) prerequisite courses: Introduction to Ecology, linear algebra.
4. The course will be given in English and all the assignments will be in English too.
