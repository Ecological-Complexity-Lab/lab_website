# Open positions

 - PhD position: [Urban Ecological Data Analysis and Modeling](https://ecomplab.com/team/join/positions/phd.html)
 - Undergrad position: [Prediction of bacterial antibiotic resistance](https://ecomplab.com/team/join/)

### We are looking for bright, quantitatively-oriented students and postdocs, who wish to take part in exciting research!

Students and postdocs with background in quantitative ecology/biology, physics, math, computer science, neuroscience, etc., who are interested in our research directions are welcome to apply. Research in the lab is computational and does not involve field or lab work. But we like working with empiricists! We have several ongoing collaborations. We can collaborate or co-mentor with a PI who has a wet lab or does field work.

# Why join the lab

Work on challenging, fun projects â€” we will work together to make sure you do what you are interested in within the scope of our research directions.
- Learn and use state-of-the-art theory and methods, preparing you for research within and outside academia.
- Work in a fun and engaging environment in the lab, the department and with collaborators.
- Close mentoring â€” my door is always open (but I wonâ€™t bug you if you donâ€™t want me to!)
- Opportunities for international collaborations for suitable candidates.

# Join us if you are...

- interested in the labâ€™s research directions (or overlapping ones),
- able to work in a team,
- curious and love to learn new science,
- enthusiastic and creative (out-of the box thinking is encouraged),
- quantitatively oriented,
- have (at least) some basic experience with programming.

# Funding
Funding options are available for graduate students and postdocs. We have open positions with full stipends ðŸ™‚ However, candidates are always encouraged to apply for external funding.

# How to apply
Please send a CV, a 1-page letter of why you are interested in joining and names of 2 referees (for recommendations).
