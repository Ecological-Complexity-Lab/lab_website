{% include section.html %}

The Ecological Complexity Lab at Ben-Gurion University is seeking a PhD student to develop and implement analytical and predictive modeling frameworks for the Urban LTER project in Israel, in collaboration with Haifa University. The candidate will integrate large-scale ecological, climatic, and social datasets to analyze spatiotemporal patterns and forecast changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in urban environments. This work will contribute directly to evidence-based urban planning and conservation strategies. Applicants should have a background in ecology, data science, or a related field, with strong quantitative analysis and programming skills (e.g., R or Python).
